       Elewa is a mission-driven organization. We make <br> use of our cooperative and shared culture to drive <br>
       the needle for the development of people and our <br> environment. We care for our own, but also
       care <br> deeply about the context surrounding us.

        Our investments are therefore not limited to <br> internal ones but contribute heavily to our <br> community and
        environment. From training the <br> next scout leaders on sustainable practices, to <br> bridging the employment gap
        for junior software developers"
